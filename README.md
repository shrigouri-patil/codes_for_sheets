# codes_for_sheets
Recently, I created a spreadsheet to organize my personal expenses. While doing so, I found it inconvenient to manually select individual cells for summation. A few years ago, I might have accepted this tedious process, but now, as I explore coding for everyday tasks, I was inspired to automate it. Using ChatGPT, I wrote my first-ever JavaScript function to sum specific colored cells within a given range.

In this repository, I plan to store scripts that enhance Google Sheets with customized functions for improved efficiency and automation.
